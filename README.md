# Retina Vessel Segmentation using Deep Learning

Deep learning model for segmenting blood vessels in retinal images.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model trained for retinal blood vessel segmentation from fundus images. The model demonstrates performance in identifying vascular structures, which can be useful for diabetic retinopathy screening and other ophthalmological applications.
